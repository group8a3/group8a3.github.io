   The task Idea our gathering has thought of is to create a site and at a later stage attempt a versatile viable application too. The site would be named "Energy Savers". On an outline of our thought, it is a straightforward site which would assist clients with saving energy just by supplanting their current appliances with new energy saving apparatuses liberated from cost. 
 
   The site would assist them with computing their current energy use just as give them a good guess of yearly investment funds by supplanting energy saver items. Every one of the items referenced on the site are supported by the Victorian Government and Essential Services Committee and are taken care of by their expenses under the Victorian Energy Upgrades (VEU) program. The site would likewise go about as a lead age site for the Accredited Providers working under a similar plan and produce income for both the developers and the organization where it adds onto saving energy utilization for the customer and the public authority.
